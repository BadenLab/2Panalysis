# twoPanalysis
A pipeline tailored for automatically pre-processing 2-photon imaging stacks from Igor Pro by Wavemetrics for ROI segmetnation and extraction via [Suite2p](https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p)'s API, allowing subsequent analysis through custom Python scripts. This repository is actively in development as part of a PhD project. 

**Disclaimer:**
This project is a work in progress. In principle, there should be no adverse effects such as overwriting data or unrecoverable loss of data. However, this project is currently actively in development and unanticipated results are to be expected (most likely in the form of errors while running).
